#+begin_info
  Discrete math is discrete, meaning it is numbered. The sand is also discrete because it can be counted.

  "The time has come," the Walrus said,
   "To talk of many things:
Of shoes—and ships—and sealing-wax—
   Of cabbages—and kings—
And why the sea is boiling hot—
   And whether pigs have wings."

  Let $n / 0$ be infinity, for any positive integer /n/.

  What English word has the largest /finite/ consonant-vowel-ratio (CVR)? For
  example, the CVRs of the words (including the TLA) in the previous sentence
  are 3:1, 5:2, 3:1, 2:1, 2:1, 5:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 2:3, and infinity (3:0).

  In the figure below, the innermost circle has radius 1. It is circumscribed by
  an equilateral triangle, which is circumscribed by a circle, which is
  circumscribed by a square, which is circumscribed by yet another circle, and
  so forth.

  What is the radius of the outermost circle?

  Pick a number (a positive integer). Form the product of that number, one more
  than that number, and one more than twice that number. Repeat for several
  different numbers. There is a pattern to these products. What is it?
#+end_note
*** Rephrase
    What is the pattern?
*** Approach
    Write down 10 numbers and brainstorm different patterns
*** Solution
    The most obvious solution is that all numbers are odd, but I found a facinating pattern
    The next number is the difference of the previous 2 number plus 4.
*** Proof
    10
    10 * 10 = 100
    100 + 1 = 101
    101 * 2 + 1 = 203

    1
    1 * 1 = 1
    1 + 1 = 2
    2 * 2 + 1 = 5

    2
    2 * 2 = 4
    4 + 1 = 5
    5 * 2 + 1 = 11

    3
    3 * 3 = 9
    9 + 1 = 10
    10 * 2 + 1 = 21

    4
    4 * 4 = 16
    16 + 1 = 17
    17 * 2 + 1 = 35

    5
    5 * 5 = 25
    25 + 1 = 26
    26 * 2 + 1 = 53



    53 - 35 = 18
    35 - 21 = 14
    21 - 11 = 10
    11 -  5 =  6

   Numbers and words. Cycles and patterns.

   Do you think mathematicians discover or invent patterns? While pondering that
   question, consider what [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy][G. H. Hardy]] famously wrote: /A mathematician, like a
   painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent/
   /than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas/. What do you think he
   meant by that?

   Here\rsquo{}s a puzzle superficially just involving a 6-digit number and a 6-letter
   \ldquo{}word\rdquo. What does

   654321

   have to do with

   CLAHCK

   other than they both follow the \ldquo{}length 6\rdquo pattern?
